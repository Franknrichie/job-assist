Description
Anywhere Clinic – Holistic Healing at Scale, Powered by AI Systems
We’re building the future of mental health:
Not just an app.
A healing system.
An AI-powered care ecosystem that integrates therapy, coaching, education, and support—where every AI agent knows how to hold space.
We're not just replacing roles.
We’re evolving them.
So that every human on our team—and every patient we serve—gets more time for what matters most: healing, presence, and growth.

Who You Are:
You’re an AI engineer or systems architect who:
Knows GPT, LangChain, and vector memory—but also gets what a client in crisis might need
Believes in automation with empathy
Builds tools that actually serve human healing, not just productivity
Has shipped real-world projects, ideally in health, wellness, or creative tech
Thinks in workflows, not just models—how AI can think, respond, triage, and uplift
You're not here to optimize clicks.
You're here to evolve care.

What You’ll Build:
AI Therapist Assistants: AI guided self-therapy support, intake, journaling, and reflection
Coaching Agents: Trained to respond to patient scenarios with therapeutic language and safety protocols
AI-Led Education Tools: Agents that teach core mental health frameworks and mirror human coaching dynamics
System Automation: Replace admin overhead with thoughtful AI - scheduling, triage, insurance verification, billing
AI Receptionists that answer with empathy
Scheduling Optimizers that balance patient schedules to minimize schedule gaps and lower no show rates
Therapeutic AI Scribes that write notes with assessment and treatment plan output guides for provider and client
Marketing Outreach Agents that connect former patients and future leads to care

Tech Stack (Flexible, Evolving):
OpenAI GPT-4 API, LangChain, Pinecone/Weaviate for vector search
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), memory systems, fine-tuning
Backend: Python/FastAPI or similar
Optional: emotion detection, voice transcription, avatar animation

The Offer:
$100–150k base salary
Work with visionary doctors, therapists, and thought leaders
Remote-first, mission-aligned, high-integrity team
A deep mission, not just a job

Who Is the Right Fit:
You’ve always wanted to work on something that feels like both code and healing.
You want to look back and say I helped rewire healthcare for good.
You're the kind of engineer who:
Knows LLM pipelines but also meditates
Believes AI isn’t dangerous if it’s built with values
Wants their work to make people feel and grow
